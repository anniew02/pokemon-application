# CPSC210 Personal Project

## What will the application do? Who will use it?
This application will allow Pokemon enthusiasts to plan out their dream team for any Pokemon game. 
Given that the user is relatively familiar with the games, they can plan out their dream team of up 
to 6 Pokemon. Each Pokemon will consist of a name, type, and whether it is holding an item. The user
will be able to add and remove Pokemon from their team, view their Party Pokemon, and give and 
items from a Pokemon. This application may be used by anyone who has played their fair share of 
Pokemon games as it will allow them to plan a team to complete a game. 

## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interest to me because growing up, I loved Pokemon games. I would often times
restart the game because I would find I didn't like my team anymore. Over quarantine, I replayed
some Pokemon games and found I could complete games given that I had a plan of which Pokemon I 
would use.

If I had more time to work on this project, I would have put more thought into the design rather 
than only focusing writing code that works. I also may not have needed to create separate classes 
for viewing and adding Pokemon, so next time I would have made more helper functions in the MainPanel 
class to improve readability of the code.
